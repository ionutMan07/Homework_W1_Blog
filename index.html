    <h2>
        The spectacle before us was indeed sublime.
    </h2>
    <p><em>Posted on 25<sup>th</sup>July 2020</em>

    <p>
<q> Apparently we had reached a great height in the atmosphere, for the sky was a dead black, and the stars
had ceased to twinkle.By the same illusion which lifts the horizon of the sea to the level of the spectator
on a hillside, the sable cloud beneath was dished out, and the car seemed to float in the middle of an immense
dark sphere, whose upper half was strewn with silver. Looking down into the dark gulf below, I could see a 
ruddy light streaming through a rift in the clouds. 
    As I went on, still gaining velocity, the palpitation of night and day merged into one continuous greyness;
the sky took on a wonderful deepness of blue, a splendid luminous color like that of early twilight; the jerking
sun became a streak of fire, a brilliant arch, in space; the moon a fainter fluctuating band; and I could see 
nothing of the stars, save now and then a brighter circle flickering in the blue.</q></p>

   <h2> Lists: General guidlines:</h2>
   <p>
    Like headings, the various types of lists are an important feature of professional technical writing: they
help readers understand, remember, and review key points; they help readers follow a sequence of actions or 
events; and they break up long stretches of straight text. Your task for this chapter is to learn about the 
different types and uses of lists and to learn their specific format and style.
   </p>
   <p>
In professional technical-writing contexts, you must use a specific style of lists, like the one presented here:
   </p>
   <ul class="list">
       <li>Use lists to highlight or emphasize text or to enumerate sequential items.
       </li>
       <li>Use exactly the spacing, indentation, punctuation, and caps style shown in the following discussion and illustrations.
       </li>
       <li>Make sure that each item in the list reads grammatically with the lead-in.
       </li>
       <li>Use a lead-in to introduce the list items and to indicate the meaning or purpose of the list (and punctuate it with a colon).
       </li>
       <li>When two items are alternatives, use a bulleted list (with or between).
       </li>
       <li> Do not use numbered lists for items connected by or. Booleans would call these ORed items.
       </li>
       <li>Indicate this OR relationship in the list lead-in.
       </li>
       <li>When a separate notice or explanatory paragraph follows a item, indent that separate material to the text of the parent list item.
       </li>
   </ul>
